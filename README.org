* Pon_{web}GL
A very simple and small Pong-style game based on WebGL. I tested it with Firefox 4 and 5 and with Chrome 14dev.

* Controls

| Action | Left player | Right player |
|--------+-------------+--------------|
| Up     | =W=         | =Up=         |
| Down   | =S=         | =Down=       |

* Bugs
- createCircle doesn't create a full circle
- collision detection to simple
